# Monster Killer
This is a simple game project developed in Vue.js to pratice some Vue concepts such as conditional rendering, classes and more.

In this game it's possible to use attacks and special attacks to the monster, and the monster attacks you back. 
It's also possible to heal, and to give up and try again. 

The game ends when either of the life points get to zero.
